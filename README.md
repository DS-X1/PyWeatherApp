# Weather App

This is a simple weather app written in Python that fetches weather data from an API and displays it to the user. The app uses Python's requests library to make API requests, and parses the JSON response to extract the relevant information, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The app also uses a GUI toolkit like Tkinter or PyQt to create a simple user interface that allows the user to enter a location and displays the current weather data.

## Planned Features

* Fetches current weather data from an API
* Displays current weather data to the user
* Allows the user to enter a location
* Supports switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit
